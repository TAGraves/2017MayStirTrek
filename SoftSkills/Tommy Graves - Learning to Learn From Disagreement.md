Disagreement is prevalent across all areas of life, and workplace disagreements can sometimes be especially heated. But what's the right response to such divisive disagreements? Drawing on the recent philosophical field called the epistemology of disagreement, I'll answer this question in a perhaps surprising way. I argue that we ought to be conciliatory in disagreements rather than doubling down on our own positions. In other words, we should give other people far more credibility than we are naturally inclined to give! Rethinking the natural approach to disagreement not only makes us more likely to arrive at the best decision in important matters, it also makes us better partners and teammates. While I don't advocate for blind agreement with others, I do propose getting a better handle on our own limits when considering questions in technical fields; better self-understanding leads to understanding others better, too.
